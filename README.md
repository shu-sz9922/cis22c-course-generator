# üìÇ CIS22C Course Structure Generator  
*A Python script to automate directory/file creation for "Sp25 CIS D022C Data Abstract & Structures" with Markdown templates.*  

> *Script developed with assistance from [DeepSeek Chat](https://deepseek.com).*


## üöÄ Purpose  
Automates the tedious process of:  
‚úÖ Creating nested directories for weekly course materials  
‚úÖ Generating pre-formatted Markdown files (e.g., `Lesson 9`, `Lab 10`)  
‚úÖ Bypassing Windows' path length limits for long filenames  
‚úÖ Adding a `TODO` tracker for assignments  

>I really have used hours modifying this project, so I want to upload it and help others saving time.
>Of course, if you have seen this :)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features  
- **Structured Templates**: Consistent headers for all files (e.g., `Class`, `Completeness`).  
- **Error Handling**: Skips files if paths are invalid and logs errors.  
- **Extended Path Support**: Uses `\\?\` prefix to avoid Windows' 260-character limit.  
- **Customizable**: Edit `template` or `todo_content` variables for different courses.  



## üõ†Ô∏è Setup  
### Requirements:  
- Python 3.6+  
- No external libraries needed.  

### Run the Script:  
```bash
python generate_course_structure.py
```
(Optional: Pass a custom root path as an argument.)

## üìÇ Generated Structure
```plaintext
Week 5. Trees, Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Week 5 Help and Discussion.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CIS22C TODO.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Lesson 9/ (Welcome, Tree ADT, Check Yourself...)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Chapter 9.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Lab 9/ (Pre-Lab Notes, Lab 9)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (Lesson 10, Chapter 10, etc.)
```

## üñäÔ∏è Customization
Edit the Structure mentioned above and these variables in the script:

```python
# Change course name/template
template = """---
Class: "Sp25 CIS D022C Data Abstract & Structures\\r"
---"""

# Modify the TODO table columns
todo_content = """
| Date       | Status  | Task          | Due     |
|------------|---------|---------------|---------|
"""
```

For the TODO table columns, the following is an example of what I normally use:
```
| Date       | Status                  | Task                                | Type / Points       | Due    |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| Mon May 6  | <input type="checkbox"> | Welcome to Lesson 9!                | Page                | 9:00pm |
```


## ‚ùì Why This Matters
Saves Time: No more manual file/directory creation.

Consistency: Ensures all files follow the same format.

Scalable: Adaptable for future courses.
